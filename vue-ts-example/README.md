## Security Note

⚠️ **Important**: This example demonstrates client-side API key usage for educational purposes. In production applications, API keys should never be exposed to the browser. Instead, implement a secure backend API that proxies requests to AI providers.

The `src/main.js` file includes a warning about this security concern. For production deployments, consider using the Node.js Express example as a backend service.

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
