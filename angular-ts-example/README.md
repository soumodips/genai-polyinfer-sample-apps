# AngularTsExample

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.17.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Security Note

⚠️ **Important**: This example demonstrates client-side API key usage for educational purposes. In production applications, API keys should never be exposed to the browser. Instead, implement a secure backend API that proxies requests to AI providers.

The `main.ts` file includes a warning about this security concern. For production deployments, consider using the Node.js Express example as a backend service.
